# SphinxCoin
A simple crypto created with Js using the crypto-js module to hash the values needed.

It has a difficulty set to 2, which means it's easy to mine a block.
By changing the difficulty you can make the block more difficult.

A fake reward system is in place so it sends an amount of money to an address, based on the blocks mined.
